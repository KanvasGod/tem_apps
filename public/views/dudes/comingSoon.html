                <p>
                    <h5>Consultations</h5>
                    Our consultation services come with a nominal charge, reflecting 
                    the expertise and value we bring to the table. The noteworthy aspect 
                    is that the entire consultation cost can be credited towards your 
                    future appointment. This means that your investment in consultations 
                    is not lost; rather, it serves as a credit that can be applied to the 
                    service you iquired about.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h5>Bundle Prices</h5>
                    Our service offers bundle pricing for your convenience. 
                    With our bundle price option, the base cost is encompassed, 
                    ensuring that you receive the fundamental service at the outset. 
                    As an added advantage, this pricing model allows you to optimize 
                    your order by including additional items of the same category at 
                    an extra cost per item. This streamlined approach ensures that you 
                    benefit from both the core service and the flexibility to add more 
                    items, all while enjoying the convenience of a 
                    unified and inclusive pricing structure.

                <p>
                    <h5>Hourly Prices</h5>
                    Our service includes a unique pricing structure for jobs labeled 
                    under hourly rates. The initial hour is seamlessly incorporated 
                    into the base price, ensuring that you receive the value you deserve 
                    right from the start. With this approach, you can confidently engage our 
                    services, knowing that the first hour's work is covered within the base rate, 
                    providing transparency and cost-efficiency for every project.
